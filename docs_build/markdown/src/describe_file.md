## Description

The `describe_file.py` module offers functionality to generate documentation and debug information for Python source files using Language Models (LLMs) through the LangChain library. It provides two main functions: `describe` and `debug`, which process input files and produce markdown output with descriptions or debug information, respectively.

The module utilizes various chat models from different vendors, which are specified by the user. It supports different LLM providers through the `available_chats` dictionary, which maps vendor names to their respective chat objects and credential requirements.

The core functionality is implemented in the `call_description` function, which sets up the LLM, constructs the appropriate messages using the provided prompt and code content, and invokes the model to generate the desired output. This function handles the interaction with the LLM, including error handling and output parsing.

Both `describe` and `debug` functions validate their input parameters, read the contents of the specified input file, and write the generated documentation to the output file. They utilize type hints and Pydantic's `validate_call` decorator to ensure proper input validation.
