# Summary

The code defines a mechanism for managing and validating embeddings, specifically focusing on OpenAI embeddings. It utilizes the `langchain_openai` library to create a dictionary of available embeddings, which currently includes a large model from OpenAI. The code also includes a validation function to ensure that only predefined embeddings are accepted. This validation is integrated with Pydantic's `Annotated` type to enforce constraints on embedding inputs.

# Description

## available_embeddings

The `available_embeddings` dictionary is a collection of embedding configurations. It maps a string identifier to a partial function that initializes an embedding model. In this case, it includes a single entry for an OpenAI large text embedding model, which is created using the `OpenAIEmbeddings` class from the `langchain_openai` library. The `partial` function is used to pre-configure the model with specific parameters, such as the model name "text-embedding-3-large".

## _is_acceptable_embedding

The `_is_acceptable_embedding` function is a validation utility that checks if a given vendor string is present in the `available_embeddings` dictionary. It uses an assertion to ensure that the vendor is valid, raising an error if the vendor is not found. This function is intended to be used as a validator to enforce that only acceptable embeddings are utilized.

## AcceptedEmbeds

`AcceptedEmbeds` is a type alias created using Pydantic's `Annotated` type. It specifies that a string value should be validated using the `_is_acceptable_embedding` function. This setup ensures that any string annotated with `AcceptedEmbeds` is checked against the available embeddings, providing a layer of validation to prevent the use of unsupported embeddings.
