# Documentation for Chat Validation Code

## Summary

This code defines a mechanism for validating chat vendors by ensuring that only predefined acceptable chat models are used. It utilizes Python's type annotations and validation techniques to enforce constraints on the selection of chat vendors. The code imports necessary modules and defines a dictionary of available chat models, mapping vendor names to their respective classes. A validation function is implemented to assert the presence of a vendor in the available options, and a type annotation is used to apply this validation.

## Description

### available_chats

The `available_chats` dictionary is a mapping of string keys to chat model classes. It defines the acceptable chat vendors by associating vendor names with their corresponding chat model classes. Currently, it includes two entries: "OPENAI" mapped to `ChatOpenAI` and "ANTHROPIC" mapped to `ChatAnthropic`. This dictionary serves as the reference for validating chat vendors.

### _is_acceptable_chat

The `_is_acceptable_chat` function is a validation function that takes a string parameter `vendor`. It asserts that the provided vendor is a key in the `available_chats` dictionary. If the assertion passes, it returns the vendor string. This function ensures that only predefined vendors are considered acceptable, preventing the use of unsupported chat models.

### AcceptedChats

`AcceptedChats` is a type annotation that combines a string type with a validation mechanism. It uses the `Annotated` type from `typing_extensions` to associate the string type with the `AfterValidator` function, which applies the `_is_acceptable_chat` validation. This annotation is used to enforce that any string representing a chat vendor must be validated against the available options.
