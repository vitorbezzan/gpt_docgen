# Summary

The provided code initializes a vector database specifically designed for use with large language models (LLMs). It processes Python files within a specified directory, generating embeddings that are stored in a structured format. The code leverages several libraries to load, parse, and split text from Python files, and then creates embeddings using a specified embedding model. The embeddings are stored in a directory for later use by LLMs, facilitating efficient retrieval and processing of code data.

# Description

## create_vector_database

The `create_vector_database` function is responsible for generating embeddings from Python files located in a specified directory. It requires several parameters to customize its operation, including the path to the directory, the name of the embedding model to use, and parameters for parsing and text splitting.

- **current_path**: This parameter specifies the path to the directory where the function will search for Python files. It is expected to be the root directory of the package.

- **embedding_name**: This parameter specifies the name of the embedding model to be used. It must be one of the accepted embedding names defined in the `AcceptedEmbeds` class.

- **parser_threshold**: This parameter sets the minimum number of lines a Python file must have to be considered for parsing. It helps filter out smaller files that may not be relevant for embedding generation.

- **chunk_size**: This parameter defines the size of text chunks to be used when splitting the content of the files. It determines how the text is divided for processing.

- **chunk_overlap**: This parameter specifies the amount of overlap between consecutive text chunks. It ensures that important information spanning across chunks is not lost during the splitting process.

The function begins by creating a directory path for storing the generated embeddings. It then uses the `GenericLoader` class to load Python files from the specified directory, excluding files with non-UTF8 encoding. The `LanguageParser` is configured to parse Python files based on the provided threshold. The loaded documents are then split into text chunks using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which is configured with the specified chunk size and overlap. Finally, the `Chroma` class is used to generate embeddings from the split text documents, utilizing the specified embedding model. The embeddings are stored in the designated directory for future use.
