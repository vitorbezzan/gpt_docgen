# describe_file.py

## Summary

This Python script provides functionality to automatically generate markdown documentation for a given code block, leveraging language models.

## Dependencies

### Standard Library
- `typing` as `tp`

### Other
- `typer`
- `langchain_core` (for `BaseChatModel`, `HumanMessage`, `SystemMessage`, and `StrOutputParser`)
- `constants` (for `_available_chats`)

## Description

The `describe_file.py` script is designed to automate the documentation process for Python code blocks. It utilizes pre-defined language models through the Langchain framework to interpret and describe the functionality, dependencies, and structure of the code. The script is capable of generating a comprehensive documentation markdown, formatted according to specified guidelines, making it a versatile tool for developers looking to streamline their documentation workflow.

The core functionality revolves around the `generate_description` function. This function accepts the name of the file to be documented, an optional vendor specifying the language model to be used, the model itself, and the code block to generate documentation for. It works by first selecting the appropriate language model and output parser based on the provided vendor and model. Then, it constructs a sequence of messages, including a system message containing a template for the documentation and a human message with the actual code block. These messages are sent to the selected language model, which generates a response interpreted as the desired documentation.

Error handling is incorporated to gracefully exit the process in case of any failures during model selection or documentation generation, ensuring robustness in various operational scenarios. This script exemplifies how language models can be harnessed to automate complex tasks like documentation generation, showcasing the potential for AI-assisted development processes.
