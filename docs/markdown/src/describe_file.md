## Description

The `describe_file.py` script is designed to automate the documentation process for Python code files by leveraging the capabilities of language models (LLMs) from various vendors, including OpenAI, Cohere, and Anthropic. The core functionality revolves around generating detailed, markdown-formatted documentation based on the input code and a predefined template.

The script initiates by importing necessary modules from the Python standard library and other dependencies. It utilizes `typer` for command-line interface operations, `typing` for type annotations, and specific modules from the `langchain` package which provides the necessary abstractions for interacting with different language models and parsing their outputs.

A dictionary named `_vendors` maps string identifiers of LLM vendors to their corresponding classes, which are capable of generating documentation through language model inference. The `generate_description` function is the centerpiece of this script, accepting parameters such as the name of the file to document, the vendor of the LLM to use, the specific model identifier, and the actual code block to document. This function orchestrates the process of selecting the appropriate language model based on the vendor, generating structured messages that include both system-generated instructions and the human-provided code block, invoking the language model, and finally parsing its output into a human-readable documentation format.

The documentation generation process relies on sending a combination of `SystemMessage` and `HumanMessage` objects to the selected LLM. These messages encapsulate the instructions for documentation generation and the code block itself. The script uses the `StrOutputParser` to convert the raw output from the LLM into a structured markdown document that adheres to the initial instructions provided in the system message.

In cases of exceptions, such as issues with instantiating the language model or invoking it with the input messages, the script gracefully exits with an appropriate error message to avoid crashing.
