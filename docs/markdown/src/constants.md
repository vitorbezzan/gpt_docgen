## Description
This Python file, `constants.py`, plays a crucial role in organizing and providing access to constant values and types across the package it belongs to. By defining constants such as `__package_name__`, `__version__`, and `__author__`, it offers essential metadata about the package, including its name, current version, and the author's contact information.

Furthermore, the file establishes two critical dictionaries: `_available_chats` and `_available_embeddings`. These dictionaries serve as registries that map string identifiers to their corresponding Python classes for chat models and embeddings, respectively.

- `_available_chats` maps identifiers to chat model classes derived from `BaseChatModel`. This allows for dynamic selection and instantiation of chat models based on the identifier, facilitating the integration and usage of different chat models, such as `ChatOllama` and `ChatOpenAI`, within the package.

- `_available_embeddings` functions similarly by mapping identifiers to embedding classes derived from the `Embeddings` base class. This registry supports the integration of different embeddings implementations like `OllamaEmbeddings` and `OpenAIEmbeddings`, enabling the package to utilize various embeddings services dynamically based on the identifier.

This setup promotes modularity and flexibility within the package, allowing for easy expansion or modification by adding new chat models or embeddings to these dictionaries without altering the core functionality of the package. It exemplifies a common pattern in software design where constants and configurations are centralized, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
