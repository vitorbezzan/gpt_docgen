# constants.py

## Summary

This code defines constants and mappings for chat models and embeddings in a package.

## Dependencies

### Standard Library

- `typing`

### Other

- `langchain_community.chat_models`
- `langchain_community.embeddings`
- `langchain_core.embeddings`
- `langchain_core.language_models.chat_models`
- `langchain_openai`

## Description

The `constants.py` file serves as a foundational component within a larger software package, tasked with the management and provision of constant values that are utilized across various parts of the package. This file specifically focuses on establishing mappings and configurations related to chat models and embeddings, which are essential elements in applications dealing with natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

The file starts by importing necessary dependencies, including types from the `typing` module for static typing, which enhances code readability and maintainability. It then imports several classes from both the `langchain_community` and `langchain_core` packages, which provide implementations of chat models and embeddings. Additionally, classes from the `langchain_openai` package are imported, indicating an integration with OpenAI's APIs or models.

Within the file, several constants are defined:

- `__package_name__`, `__version__`, and `__author__` offer basic metadata about the package, including its name, current version, and the author's contact information. This metadata is crucial for package management and distribution.

- `_available_chats` is a dictionary mapping string identifiers to chat model classes. This mapping facilitates dynamic instantiation of chat models based on string identifiers, allowing for flexible use of different chat models within the package.

- `_available_embeddings` performs a similar role for embeddings, mapping string identifiers to embedding classes. Embeddings are dense vector representations of text, and having a flexible mapping system allows the package to utilize various embedding models seamlessly.

By providing these mappings and constants, `constants.py` acts as a central point of reference for managing chat models and embeddings within the package. This approach streamlines the integration of different models and facilitates easy extension or modification of the package to include new models or embeddings in the future.
