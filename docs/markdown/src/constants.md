## Description

The `constants.py` file is a central repository for the constant values that are used throughout the `bezzanlabs.gpt_docgen` package. By defining constants in a separate file, the package ensures that these values are easily maintainable and accessible across different modules.

This file includes constants such as `__package_name__`, `__version__`, and `__author__`:

- `__package_name__`: Defines the name of the package. This is useful for logging, debugging, or any functionality that requires the program to be aware of its package name.
- `__version__`: Specifies the current version of the package. This is crucial for dependency management, package updates, and compatibility checks.
- `__author__`: Contains the name and contact information of the primary author or maintainer of the package. This information is valuable for users or developers who may have questions or need to report issues.

These constants are typically accessed by other modules within the package to retrieve essential metadata about the package itself. For instance, documentation tools or package management systems might use these values to generate documentation or manage package versions.
