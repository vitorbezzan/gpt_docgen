# constants.py

## Summary

This code defines a set of constants used across the package, including available chat models and package metadata.

## Dependencies

### Standard Library

- None

### Other

- `langchain_anthropic`
- `langchain_cohere`
- `langchain_openai`

## Description

The `constants.py` file serves as a centralized location for defining and managing constants used throughout the package. This includes metadata about the package itself such as its name, version, and author, as well as a dictionary of available chat models. The constants defined in this file are essential for ensuring consistency and manageability of the package's configurations and options.

The metadata includes the package name (`__package_name__`), its current version (`__version__`), and the author's details (`__author__`). Such metadata is crucial for package distribution and maintenance, providing users and developers with basic information about the package.

Additionally, the file maps a set of keys to specific chat model classes from various libraries through the `_available_chats` dictionary. This mapping facilitates the dynamic selection and instantiation of chat models based on the user's preferences or requirements. The keys represent the names of the chat services (e.g., "openai", "cohere", "anthropic"), and the values are the respective classes from imported modules that implement the functionality for interacting with these services. This approach allows for a modular and flexible architecture where new chat models can be easily added or removed by updating this dictionary.

In summary, `constants.py` plays a pivotal role in the package's configuration, providing a single source of truth for important constants that influence the package's behavior and its interaction with external services.
