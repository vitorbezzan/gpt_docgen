## Description
The `embedding.py` file is responsible for generating embeddings for code within a specified directory. These embeddings are generated using the `Chroma` model from the `langchain_chroma` package, which is a tool designed for working with language models in various capacities. This process involves several steps, starting with the loading of documents from the filesystem using the `GenericLoader` class. This class is configured to load all Python files (`.py`) from the specified directory, excluding any files with non-UTF-8 encoding.

Once the documents are loaded, the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from the `langchain_text_splitters` package is used to split the documents into chunks. This is necessary because language models typically have limitations on the amount of text they can process in a single request. The documents are split into chunks of 2000 characters with an overlap of 200 characters to ensure continuity and context are maintained across chunks.

The `Chroma` model is then instantiated with the documents (now in text chunks) and the specified embedding model. The embedding model is selected based on the `vendor` parameter, which must match one of the pre-defined vendors in the `_available_embeddings` dictionary. The embedding process is vendor-specific and allows for flexibility in choosing the underlying model for generating embeddings.

Finally, the generated embeddings are persisted in the `docs/embeddings/` directory within the current path. This functionality enables the automatic generation of embeddings for code, which can be useful for various applications such as documentation, code analysis, or machine learning tasks that require understanding the semantics of code.

This script showcases the use of modern language processing techniques to automate the embedding generation process for Python codebases. It leverages the power of language models and provides an interface for specifying different vendors/models, making it a versatile tool for developers and researchers working in the field of natural language processing and code analysis.
