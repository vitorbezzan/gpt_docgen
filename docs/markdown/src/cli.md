# cli.py

## Summary

This code provides a command-line interface (CLI) for generating markdown documentation for Python files or directories containing Python files using a language model.

## Dependencies

### Standard Library
- `glob`
- `os`
- `pathlib`

### Other
- `typer`
- `dotenv`
- `pydantic`

## Description

The `cli.py` module is designed to facilitate the automation of documentation generation for Python projects. It leverages the command-line interface utility `typer` for parsing and executing commands, `dotenv` for environment variable management, and `pydantic` for data validation and settings management. The core functionality of this CLI tool revolves around reading Python files, generating descriptions for them using a machine learning model, and then saving those descriptions as markdown (.md) files.

Upon execution, the CLI can perform two main actions based on the command: `describe_file` and `describe_dir`. The `describe_file` command processes a single Python file specified by the user, generating a markdown file with a description as interpreted by the language model. Similarly, the `describe_dir` command iterates over a directory, generating markdown files for each Python file encountered (excluding `__init__.py` files). This allows for bulk processing of Python files, which is particularly useful for large projects.

The CLI also supports custom configuration through the use of an environment file. Users can specify the path to an environment file containing necessary configuration variables, which the CLI will then load and apply. This functionality is facilitated through the `dotenv` package, which is adept at managing environment variables for Python projects.

Moreover, the CLI includes a version information feature that displays the current version of the package when invoked. This can be useful for users to verify the version of the tool they are using.

This utility stands out by not just automating the documentation process but doing so in a way that is highly configurable and adaptable to the needs of various projects. By leveraging the power of modern language models, it aims to produce high-quality, human-readable documentation that can significantly enhance code readability and maintenance.
