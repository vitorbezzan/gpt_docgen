## Description

The `cli.py` script provides a command-line interface to automate the generation of markdown documentation for Python files. It utilizes the Typer library for the CLI functionality, enabling a user-friendly way to interact with the script's features. The script can process individual Python files or entire directories, generating a markdown file for each Python file encountered.

At the heart of this script are two main commands: `describe_file` and `describe_dir`. The `describe_file` command takes a path to a Python file, along with optional parameters for specifying the language model vendor and model version, and generates a markdown file containing the documentation for the Python file. Similarly, the `describe_dir` command processes all Python files within a specified directory, excluding any `__init__.py` files, and generates corresponding markdown documentation for each file.

The script also handles environment variables by loading them from a specified `.env` file at startup. This feature allows for the configuration of the script's behavior through external settings, such as API keys or environment-specific parameters, enhancing its flexibility and ease of use in different environments.

The version information of the package can be displayed using the `--version` or `-v` option, which provides immediate feedback on the script's current version as specified by the `__version__` variable imported from the `constants` module.

In summary, `cli.py` is a versatile tool designed to leverage language models for the automatic generation of markdown documentation, catering to both individual files and directories. Its integration with environment variables and the Typer library for command-line options makes it highly configurable and easy to use.
