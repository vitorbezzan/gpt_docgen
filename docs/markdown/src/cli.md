# cli.py

## Summary
This code provides a command-line interface (CLI) for generating markdown documentation and embeddings for files and directories using language models.

## Dependencies

### Standard Library
- `glob`
- `os`
- `pathlib`
- `typing`

### Other
- `typer`
- `dotenv`

## Description
The `cli.py` file is an essential part of a package designed to interact with the user through the command line, offering a range of functionalities like generating markdown documentation for Python files, handling environment variables, and creating embeddings using large language models (LLMs). This CLI tool leverages the `typer` library for creating the CLI and the `dotenv` library for managing environment variables, which enhances the user's ability to control and automate the documentation and embedding generation processes.

The CLI provides commands for generating markdown documentation for individual files or entire directories, handling environment variables through a specified `.env` file, and generating README files or embeddings for directories. The commands are designed to be intuitive and provide immediate feedback to the user, including error handling for common scenarios like missing files or directories.

The `describe_file` and `describe_dir` commands utilize a language model (defaulting to `gpt-4-turbo-preview`) to generate markdown documentation for Python files. These commands are flexible, allowing the user to specify the vendor and model of the language processing service. This feature is particularly useful for developers looking to automate the documentation of their projects, ensuring consistency and saving time.

In addition to documentation generation, the CLI offers functionality for creating a high-level overview of a project's structure through embeddings with the `embedding` command and for generating a project README with the `readme` command. These features leverage the power of LLMs to synthesize and present complex information in a more accessible format.

Overall, `cli.py` is a robust tool designed to simplify and automate the process of generating documentation and embeddings for Python projects. Its integration of environment variable management, error handling, and customization options makes it a valuable asset for developers looking to improve their workflow.
