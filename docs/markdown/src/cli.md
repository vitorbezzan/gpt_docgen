# cli.py

## Summary

This code defines a command-line interface (CLI) tool for generating markdown documentation for Python files and directories, managing environment variables, and creating embeddings, utilizing the capabilities of language models.

## Dependencies

### Standard Library

- `glob`
- `os`
- `pathlib`
- `typing`

### Other

- `typer`
- `dotenv`

## Description

The `cli.py` module serves as the command-line interface entry point for a package designed to leverage language models for generating documentation and embeddings. It uses the Typer library for creating the CLI, allowing for an easy definition of commands and options. This CLI tool facilitates several operations including the generation of markdown documentation for Python files and directories, loading and displaying environment variables from an `.env` file, and creating embeddings using language models.

Upon execution, the CLI tool supports the following commands:

- **describe_file**: Given a path to a Python file, it uses a specified language model to generate a markdown file that describes the Python file's content. This command allows specifying the vendor and model of the language model to be used.

- **describe_dir**: This command extends the functionality of `describe_file` to a directory, generating markdown documentation for each Python file found within the specified directory, excluding any `__init__.py` files. The generated markdown files are saved in a structured directory under `docs/markdown` relative to the current working directory.

- **embedding**: Generates embeddings for the Python files within the current working directory, creating a README markdown file that includes simple explanations for each component. The embeddings are saved in a directory structure under `docs/embedding`.

The CLI also provides a callback function, `main`, which is used to handle global options such as specifying an environment file path with `-e` or `--environment` and displaying the application's version with `-v` or `--version`. The environment file path option allows users to load custom environment variables from a specified file, enhancing the flexibility in managing configurations.

The tool is built with extensibility and ease of use in mind, making it straightforward to add additional commands or modify existing ones. The use of Typer for the CLI design ensures that adding new features or commands is a relatively simple process, requiring minimal boilerplate code.
