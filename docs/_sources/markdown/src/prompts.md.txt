## Description

The `prompts.py` file defines a set of string templates used for generating various types of documentation for Python code. These prompts are designed to be used with an AI assistant or documentation generation tool to create consistent and comprehensive documentation.

The file contains three main prompts:

1. `description_prompt`: This prompt is used to generate markdown documentation for a Python file. It instructs the AI to create a document with specific sections including a summary, dependencies list, and a detailed description of the code's functionality.

2. `debug_prompt`: This prompt is designed to generate a markdown file focused on debugging and improving the code. It includes sections for summarizing the code, describing the main algorithm, suggesting improvement opportunities, and identifying potential safety issues.

3. `readme_prompt`: This prompt is used to generate a README markdown file for a codebase. It instructs the AI to create a document with sections for introducing the project, explaining installation procedures, and providing a brief usage example.

Each prompt is structured to guide the AI in producing comprehensive and useful documentation, ensuring consistency across different parts of a project or codebase.
