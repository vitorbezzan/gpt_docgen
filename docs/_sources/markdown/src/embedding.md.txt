## Description

This module provides functionality for generating embeddings of Python code files and creating README documentation using language models. It consists of two main functions: `generate_embedding` and `generate_readme`.

The `generate_embedding` function takes a directory path as input and generates embeddings for all Python files in that directory and its subdirectories. It uses the GenericLoader from langchain_community to load the files, and the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to split the documents into smaller chunks. The resulting embeddings are stored using Chroma in a specified directory.

The `generate_readme` function uses the previously generated embeddings to create a README file for the code. It takes the current path, a chat vendor, and a model name as input. It retrieves the embeddings, sets up a conversational retrieval chain using the specified language model, and generates the README content based on a predefined prompt. The resulting README is then written to a file.

Both functions use Pydantic's `validate_call` decorator for input validation, ensuring that the provided arguments meet the expected types and formats.
